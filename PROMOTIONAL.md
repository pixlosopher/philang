## What is PhiLang?

PhiLang is an experimental programming language and visualization system for exploring philosophical concepts. It provides a formal grammar for expressing relationships between ideas from the great philosophical traditions—from Buddhist emptiness to Hegelian dialectics, from Phenomenology to Process Philosophy.

```
emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance
```
*"Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance"*

## Features

### 🔮 Derivation Graph
Visualize concept relationships through magnetic force-directed networks. Drag concepts to build derivations, watch semantic affinity reveal philosophical connections.

### ⚔️ Dialectical Dialogue
Simulate debates between 10 philosophical traditions. Watch Phenomenology argue with Buddhism, Hegelianism confront Poststructuralism—powered by Claude AI for genuine philosophical reasoning.

### 🧘 Socratic Counsel
Philosophical therapy sessions. Engage in Socratic dialogue, receive Stoic counsel, practice Buddhist mindful inquiry, or face existential confrontation.

### 🧠 Semantic Embeddings
Train neural embeddings on PhiLang concepts. Explore 32D/64D vector spaces with PCA visualization, k-means clustering, and philosophical analogy discovery.

## Core Concepts

PhiLang includes primitives from major philosophical traditions:

| Tradition | Concepts |
|-----------|----------|
| **Phenomenology** | Self, Other, Horizon, Flesh, Intentionality |
| **Buddhism** | Emptiness (śūnyatā), Dependent Origination, Buddha-nature |
| **Hegelianism** | Aufhebung, Dialectic, Absolute Spirit |
| **Process Philosophy** | Concrescence, Prehension, Creativity |
| **Poststructuralism** | Différance, Fold, Rhizome |
| **Spinozism** | Substance, Modes, Conatus |
| + 4 more traditions | Aristotelian, Platonic, Kantian, Wittgensteinian |

## Operators

The grammar of philosophical transformation:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `→` | Derivation | A derives B |
| `⊗` | Synthesis | A combined with B |
| `¬` | Negation | Dialectical negation |
| `⟨ ⟩` | Epoché | Phenomenological bracket |
| `∘` | Composition | A composed with B |
| `↺` | Recursion | Self-referential |
| `∅` | Emptiness | Void, absence |
| `Δ` | Difference | Change, becoming |

## Hacker News Post

### Title (choose one):
- `Show HN: PhiLang – A programming language for philosophical concepts`
- `Show HN: I built a tool to visualize and derive philosophical concepts with AI`
- `Show HN: PhiLang – Compute with philosophy like you compute with numbers`

### Body:

```
Hey HN,

I built PhiLang, an experimental "programming language" for philosophical concepts. The idea started as a thought experiment: what if we could express philosophical relationships with formal syntax?

Live demo: https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/
GitHub: https://github.com/pixlosopher/philang

For example, this expression:

    emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance

reads as "Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance" — a key insight from Madhyamaka Buddhism.

Features:
- Derivation Graph: D3.js force-directed visualization where concepts cluster by semantic affinity
- Dialectical Dialogue: AI-powered debates between philosophical traditions (Phenomenology vs Buddhism, Hegel vs Deleuze, etc.)
- Socratic Counsel: Philosophical therapy sessions using different methods
- Semantic Embeddings: Train skip-gram embeddings on philosophical concepts, visualize with PCA/t-SNE

The AI integration uses Claude, which does surprisingly good philosophical reasoning. The prompts give it context about each tradition's key concepts and argumentative style, so you get debates that feel genuine rather than generic.

Tech stack: Vanilla JS, D3.js, Tailwind, Claude API. No framework dependencies—the whole thing runs client-side from GitHub Pages.

I'm especially interested in feedback on:
1. The concept ontology—are key ideas from each tradition well-represented?
2. The derivation mechanics—does the syntax feel intuitive?
3. Educational potential—could this help teach philosophy?

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation or philosophical choices.
```

## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: Main Launch Thread

```
🧵 I built a programming language for philosophy.

It sounds absurd, but hear me out.

PhiLang lets you write things like:

    emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance

"Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance"

Here's what it does 👇

---

1/ The Derivation Graph

Drag philosophical concepts from 10 traditions onto a force-directed canvas.

Watch them cluster by semantic affinity—Buddhist concepts naturally attract each other, but also pull toward Process Philosophy.

Derive new insights by combining ideas.

[screenshot of derivation graph]

---

2/ Dialectical Dialogue

Ever wonder how Hegel would respond to Derrida?

PhiLang simulates debates between philosophical traditions, powered by Claude AI.

Pick 2-4 traditions, choose a topic like "What is the nature of time?" and watch them argue.

[screenshot of dialogue]

---

3/ Socratic Counsel

Philosophy as therapy.

Engage in:
- Socratic dialogue
- Stoic counsel
- Buddhist mindful inquiry
- Existential confrontation
- Phenomenological exploration

The AI adapts its method to help you examine your thinking.

---

4/ Why build this?

Philosophy has formal structures—syllogisms, dialectics, phenomenological reductions.

I wanted to make them interactive and computable.

Not to reduce philosophy to algorithms, but to explore it in new ways.

---

5/ Try it yourself:

🔗 https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

It's free, runs in your browser, and works without an API key (though Claude makes it way better).

Built with: D3.js, vanilla JS, Claude API

Would love your feedback! What traditions should I add?
```

### Thread 2: Technical Deep Dive

```
🧵 How do you build a "programming language" for philosophy?

A technical thread on PhiLang's architecture.

---

1/ The Concept Ontology

Each philosophical tradition has:
- Core concepts (with symbols)
- Semantic tags for affinity
- Typical argument patterns
- Key thinkers

This creates a graph structure where edges = philosophical relationships.

---

2/ The Grammar

Operators borrowed from logic + phenomenology:

→ Derivation
⊗ Synthesis
¬ Negation
⟨ ⟩ Epoché (phenomenological bracket)
∘ Composition
↺ Recursion

These map loosely to logical operations but preserve philosophical meaning.

---

3/ Force-Directed Visualization

D3.js simulates magnetic forces between concepts.

Affinity = attractive force
Difference = repulsive force

Result: concepts self-organize into meaningful clusters.

Derivations create visible edges between nodes.

---

4/ AI Integration

Claude gets prompts like:

"You are a Phenomenologist in the tradition of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty. Your core concepts are intentionality, horizon, flesh, lifeworld. Argue for your position on: [topic]"

This creates debates that feel philosophically grounded.

---

5/ Embeddings

Skip-gram architecture trains on concept co-occurrence.

Output: 32D or 64D vectors where:
- king - man + woman ≈ queen

becomes:
- substance - Spinoza + Buddhism ≈ ?

Philosophical analogy completion.

---

6/ Stack

- Vanilla JS (no framework)
- D3.js for viz
- Tailwind for styling
- IndexedDB for persistence
- Claude API for reasoning

Everything runs client-side. ~40KB of JS total.

GitHub: https://github.com/pixlosopher/philang
```

### Thread 3: Philosophy-Focused

```
🧵 What if philosophical traditions could actually debate each other?

Not cherry-picked quotes. Real-time dialectical exchange.

I built a tool that does this. It's called PhiLang.

---

1/ The problem with cross-tradition dialogue:

- Phenomenologists and Buddhists use different vocabularies
- Analytical and Continental philosophers talk past each other
- We read ABOUT debates but rarely see them unfold

PhiLang creates a space for this.

---

2/ 10 Traditions, One Arena

- Phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty)
- Buddhism (Nāgārjuna, Candrakīrti)
- Hegelianism (Hegel, Žižek)
- Poststructuralism (Deleuze, Derrida)
- Process Philosophy (Whitehead)
- Spinozism
- Early & Late Wittgenstein
- Kantian
- Aristotelian
- Platonic

---

3/ Example: Buddhism vs Hegelianism on "self"

Buddhist: "The self is empty (śūnyatā). What you call 'self' is merely dependent origination—a temporary confluence of conditions."

Hegelian: "But this emptiness is precisely the negative moment through which Spirit recognizes itself..."

---

4/ The debates reveal real tensions:

- Buddhism's non-self vs Phenomenology's transcendental ego
- Deleuze's difference vs Hegel's dialectical negation
- Wittgenstein's language-games vs Husserl's essences

These aren't new—but seeing them argued in real-time is illuminating.

---

5/ It's also a learning tool.

Don't understand Aufhebung? Watch it get deployed in an argument.

Confused by différance? See how Derrida would respond to Aristotle on substance.

Philosophy through debate, not just reading.

---

6/ Try it:

https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/dialectical_dialogue.html

Pick traditions. Choose a question. Watch them argue.

What topics would you want to see debated?
```

### r/philosophy Post

**Title:** I built an interactive tool for exploring philosophical concepts across traditions - would love feedback from this community

**Body:**

```
Hi r/philosophy,

I've been working on a project called PhiLang that tries to make philosophical concepts more interactive and explorable. It's essentially a "philosophical programming language" with visualization tools.

**What it does:**

1. **Derivation Graph** - A visual canvas where you can drag concepts from different traditions and see how they relate. The force-directed layout clusters concepts by semantic affinity.

2. **Dialectical Dialogue** - AI-simulated debates between philosophical traditions. You pick 2-4 traditions (Phenomenology, Buddhism, Hegelianism, Poststructuralism, etc.) and a topic, then watch them argue.

3. **Socratic Counsel** - Philosophical therapy using different methods (Socratic questioning, Stoic counsel, Buddhist mindful inquiry, existential confrontation).

**The concept ontology includes:**
- Phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty)
- Buddhism (Nāgārjuna, Madhyamaka)
- Hegelianism (with Žižek influences)
- Process Philosophy (Whitehead)
- Poststructuralism (Deleuze, Derrida)
- Spinozism
- Both early and late Wittgenstein
- Plus Kantian, Aristotelian, and Platonic traditions

**Example syntax:**
```
emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance
```
"Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance"

**Link:** https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

**I'm particularly interested in feedback on:**

1. Are the core concepts from each tradition well-chosen? I'm sure I've missed important ones.

2. The AI debates—do they feel philosophically genuine or like surface-level pastiche?

3. Educational value—could this help teach philosophical concepts?

4. What traditions should I add? I've been considering adding Confucianism, Daoism, African philosophy, and Indian schools beyond Buddhism.

This is a passion project, not an academic tool, but I'd love input from people who actually study philosophy. Happy to discuss the philosophical assumptions baked into the system.
```

### r/programming Post

**Title:** Show r/programming: PhiLang - A domain-specific language for philosophical concepts with D3.js visualization

**Body:**

```
I built an unusual DSL that lets you express philosophical relationships using a formal syntax.

**Live demo:** https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

**GitHub:** https://github.com/pixlosopher/philang

**The syntax looks like:**
```
emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance
```

Which reads as: "Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance"

**Operators:**
- `→` Derivation
- `⊗` Synthesis
- `¬` Negation
- `⟨ ⟩` Epoché (phenomenological bracketing)
- `∘` Composition
- `↺` Recursion

**Technical highlights:**

1. **Force-directed graph** using D3.js where concepts cluster by semantic affinity
2. **AI integration** with Claude for generating philosophical dialogues
3. **Skip-gram embeddings** trained on philosophical concepts (like word2vec but for philosophy)
4. **Zero framework dependencies** - vanilla JS, D3, and Tailwind
5. **Client-side only** - everything runs in the browser, hosted on GitHub Pages

**Stack:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (~40KB)
- D3.js for visualization
- Tailwind CSS
- IndexedDB for persistence
- Claude API (Anthropic) for AI features

**Interesting challenges:**

- Designing a grammar that's both formal enough to be meaningful and loose enough to capture philosophical nuance
- Creating an ontology of concepts across 10 philosophical traditions
- Making force-directed layouts that produce meaningful clustering
- Prompt engineering for genuine philosophical reasoning (not just surface-level responses)

Would love feedback on the codebase or suggestions for improvement. The AI prompts in particular could use refinement.
```

### r/ClaudeAI Post

**Title:** Built a philosophical reasoning tool with Claude - the results are surprisingly good

**Body:**

```
I've been experimenting with Claude for philosophical reasoning and built a tool called PhiLang that demonstrates what's possible.

**Demo:** https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

**The most interesting feature: Dialectical Dialogue**

You pick 2-4 philosophical traditions (Buddhism, Phenomenology, Hegelianism, Poststructuralism, etc.) and a topic. Claude then simulates a debate between them.

**What surprised me:**

Claude actually engages with the core concepts of each tradition rather than just generating generic philosophy-sounding text. When "playing" a Hegelian, it properly uses dialectical structure. When arguing as a Buddhist, it genuinely engages with emptiness and dependent origination.

**The prompt structure:**

Each tradition has:
- Core concepts with definitions
- Key thinkers to channel
- Typical argumentative moves
- Concepts it tends to oppose

For example, the Buddhism prompt includes:
```
Core concepts: śūnyatā (emptiness), pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination), anātman (non-self), Buddha-nature
Thinkers: Nāgārjuna, Candrakīrti
Argue through: negation of inherent existence, two truths doctrine, madhyamaka logic
```

**Example output:**

Topic: "What is consciousness?"

**Phenomenologist:** "Consciousness is always consciousness-of-something. The intentional structure reveals that subjectivity is not a container but a directedness toward the world..."

**Buddhist:** "This intentional structure you describe still posits a substantial self that 'has' experiences. But when we examine consciousness, we find only the flow of dependent arising—no experiencer behind the experience..."

**Also included:**
- Socratic Counsel for philosophical therapy
- Concept derivation with formal syntax
- Semantic embeddings (word2vec-style but for philosophy)

Curious if others have explored Claude for philosophical reasoning. What prompting strategies have worked for you?

# Building a Programming Language for Philosophy: A Technical Journey

What happens when you try to apply programming language concepts to philosophy? I spent several months finding out, and the result is [PhiLang](https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/)—an experimental system for exploring philosophical concepts through code.

## The Weird Idea

Philosophy has always had formal structures. Aristotle gave us syllogisms. Kant had his categories. Hegel developed dialectics. Husserl created phenomenological reduction.

These aren't just rhetorical devices—they're *operations* on concepts. So what if we made them explicit and computable?

## The Grammar

PhiLang uses a simple syntax inspired by mathematical logic and phenomenology:

```
emptiness ⊗ dep-orig → ¬substance
```

This reads: "Emptiness synthesized with dependent origination derives the negation of substance."

The operators:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `→` | Derivation | A leads to B |
| `⊗` | Synthesis | A combined with B |
| `¬` | Negation | Dialectical negation |
| `⟨ ⟩` | Epoché | Phenomenological bracketing |
| `∘` | Composition | A composed with B |
| `↺` | Recursion | Self-reference |

## The Concept Ontology

Every programming language needs primitives. PhiLang's primitives are philosophical concepts from 10 traditions:

```javascript
const traditions = {
  phenomenology: {
    concepts: ['self', 'other', 'horizon', 'flesh', 'intentionality'],
    thinkers: ['Husserl', 'Merleau-Ponty'],
    color: '#6366f1'
  },
  buddhism: {
    concepts: ['emptiness', 'dependent-origination', 'non-self', 'buddha-nature'],
    thinkers: ['Nāgārjuna', 'Candrakīrti'],
    color: '#10b981'
  },
  // ... 8 more traditions
};
```

Each concept has semantic tags that determine affinity with other concepts—this drives the visualization.

## Visualization with D3.js

The Derivation Graph uses D3's force simulation to create a living map of philosophical space:

```javascript
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-100))
  .force('link', d3.forceLink(links).distance(60))
  .force('affinity', customAffinityForce());
```

The `customAffinityForce` pulls concepts together based on semantic similarity. Buddhist concepts cluster together, but also drift toward Process Philosophy (both emphasize impermanence and becoming).

## AI Integration

The most interesting part: getting Claude to argue philosophically.

Naive prompts produce generic philosophy-speak. The trick is giving Claude the *structure* of each tradition's argumentation:

```javascript
const phenomenologyPrompt = `
You are arguing from the Phenomenological tradition.

CORE MOVES:
- Begin with lived experience
- Bracket metaphysical assumptions (epoché)
- Describe intentional structures
- Reveal the pre-reflective ground of concepts

CONCEPTS TO DEPLOY:
intentionality, horizon, lifeworld, flesh, intersubjectivity

RESPOND TO: ${opponentArgument}
`;
```

This produces debates that feel philosophically grounded rather than surface-level.

## Embeddings: Word2Vec for Philosophy

The advanced embeddings module trains skip-gram embeddings on philosophical concepts:

```javascript
// After training...
const result = analogy('substance', 'spinoza', 'buddhism');
// Returns concepts similar to how 'substance' relates to Spinoza,
// but in Buddhist terms → might return 'dharma' or 'svabhāva'
```

This enables philosophical analogy completion and reveals hidden relationships between traditions.

## Architecture Decisions

**No Framework**: The entire app is vanilla JavaScript. Philosophy shouldn't require a 500KB framework to explore.

**Client-Side Only**: Everything runs in the browser. Your philosophical explorations stay private.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Works without the AI features. Claude makes it better but isn't required.

**IndexedDB for Persistence**: Save your derivations and dialogues locally.

## Challenges

1. **Ontology Design**: Choosing which concepts to include is itself a philosophical choice. The selection inevitably reflects biases.

2. **Formal vs. Fuzzy**: Philosophy resists formalization. The grammar is loose enough to capture nuance but structured enough to be meaningful.

3. **AI Authenticity**: Getting AI to argue philosophically rather than *sound* philosophical required careful prompt engineering.

4. **Visualization Clarity**: Too many concepts overwhelm. Too few feel limiting. The current balance is ~150 concepts across 10 traditions.

## Try It

**Live Demo:** https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

**GitHub:** https://github.com/pixlosopher/philang

I'd love feedback, especially from philosophers who can tell me what I've gotten wrong. What concepts are missing? What traditions should be added?

## Philosophy Forum Post

**Title:** Experimental Tool for Cross-Traditional Philosophical Dialogue - Seeking Feedback

**Body:**

```
Hello everyone,

I've created an experimental tool called PhiLang that I'd like to share with this community. It's an attempt to make philosophical concepts more interactive and to facilitate dialogue between different traditions.

**What PhiLang Does:**

1. **Concept Mapping**: A visual space where concepts from different traditions can be placed and connected. The visualization groups concepts by philosophical affinity—Buddhist concepts cluster near Process Philosophy, Phenomenology near Existentialism, etc.

2. **Cross-Traditional Dialogue**: Using AI, the tool can simulate debates between philosophical traditions. You might ask: "What is the nature of time?" and watch Phenomenology, Buddhism, and Hegelianism each respond and engage with each other.

3. **Socratic Sessions**: Philosophical therapy using different methods—Socratic questioning, Stoic counsel, Buddhist inquiry, existential confrontation.

**The Traditions Currently Included:**
- Phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty)
- Buddhism (Nāgārjuna, Madhyamaka)
- Hegelianism
- Poststructuralism (Deleuze, Derrida)
- Process Philosophy (Whitehead)
- Spinozism
- Early Wittgenstein (Tractatus)
- Late Wittgenstein (Investigations)
- Kantian
- Aristotelian
- Platonic

**Link:** https://pixlosopher.github.io/philang/

**Questions for the Community:**

1. **Concept Selection**: For each tradition, I've selected core concepts. Are there glaring omissions? For Buddhism, I have: śūnyatā, pratītyasamutpāda, anātman, Buddha-nature, the two truths. What's missing?

2. **AI Dialogue Quality**: The debates are AI-generated. Do they capture genuine philosophical reasoning or just mimic philosophical language? I've tried to give each tradition its authentic argumentative structure.

3. **Cross-Traditional Connections**: The tool suggests affinities between traditions (e.g., Buddhist emptiness and Hegelian negation, Whitehead's process and Buddhist impermanence). Are these connections philosophically defensible or superficial?

4. **Missing Traditions**: I'd like to add more non-Western traditions. Daoism, Confucianism, and various Indian schools (beyond Buddhism) are on my list. What else should be included?

5. **Educational Value**: Could something like this help students understand philosophical concepts? Or does the formalization distort the content?

I'm not a professional philosopher—this is a passion project. I'd genuinely appreciate critical feedback from people who engage with these traditions seriously.

Thank you for your time.
